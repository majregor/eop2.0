    <p>Now  that your planning team has an approved EOP, Step 6 will prompt your team to  implement the plan by training stakeholders; conducting drills and exercises;  and reviewing, revising, and maintaining the plan. Through the process of reviewing  and revising the plan, Step 6 closes the loop in the six step planning process  by prompting the planning team to begin the process again.</p>
    <p><strong>Train Stakeholders on the Plan</strong></p>
    <p>The  first step in implementing the school EOP is to train everyone involved in the  plan on his or her roles and responsibilities before, during, and after an  emergency. </p>
    <p><strong>Exercise the Plan</strong></p>
    <p>Next,  your planning team will need to exercise the plan. Drills and exercises will  help stakeholders practice their roles and responsibilities before, during, and  after an emergency, and provide important information to the planning team  regarding the effectiveness of the plan. </p>
    <p><strong>Review, Revise, and Maintain the Plan</strong></p>
    <p>Once  a plan has been implemented, the planning team will need to update the plan  regularly, either in part or in whole. </p>
    <p><strong>Closing the Loop in the Planning Process</strong></p>
    <p>Step  6 closes the loop in the six step planning process and starts the planning  cycle over again. A high-quality plan is one that continually evolves to meet  the needs of the school and the surrounding community. </p>
    <p><strong>Outcome of Step 6</strong></p>
    <p>At  the conclusion of Step 6, your plan will be implemented and the planning cycle  will begin again.</p>
