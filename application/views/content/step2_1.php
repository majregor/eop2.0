    <p>Now that your school has a collaborative planning team, it is time to begin the process of developing your school&rsquo;s EOP. Step 2 will prompt your team to develop a comprehensive,
        yet prioritized list of <a href="<?php echo(base_url());?>assets/resources/examples_of_threats_and_hazards.pdf" target="_blank">threats and hazards</a> to be addressed in the school EOP.</p>
    <p><strong></strong></p>
    <p><strong>Develop a Comprehensive List of Possible Threats and Hazards Using a Variety of Data Sources</strong></p>
    <p>Your team&rsquo;s first task is to develop a comprehensive list of threats and hazards by consulting a variety of data sources, including: school and district assessment data; information from local, State, and Federal partners; and information from the school community. </p>
    <p><strong>Evaluate Risks and Vulnerabilities of Threats and Hazards and Then Prioritize</strong></p>
    <p>After your team develops a comprehensive list of possible threats and hazards, the team should evaluate the risk and vulnerability of each of the threats and hazards. This evaluation will help your planning team to prioritize and refine the list of threats and hazards that will be addressed in your school EOP. </p>
    <p><strong>Outcome of Step 2</strong></p>
    <p>At the conclusion of Step 2, your planning team should have a prioritized list of threats and hazards that will be carried forward to Step 3. In Step 3, your planning team will begin developing response measures to address those prioritized threats and hazards.</p>
