    <p>Your  team&rsquo;s first task is to develop a comprehensive list of threats and hazards by  consulting a variety of data sources. Different data sources that may provide  information on threats and hazards in your school and community are as follows:</p>
    <ul>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Data  from school and district assessments.</strong> Your school and/or district  should regularly conduct assessments to learn information about safety and  security in your school. The data generated from each of the following types of  assessments may provide critical information about threats and hazards in your  school community. Click on each assessment below to learn about these different  types of assessments. </li>

This assessment includes, but is not limited to, the following: a review of building access and egress control measures, visibility around the exterior of the building, structural integrity of the building, compliance with applicable architectural standards for individuals with disabilities and other access and functional needs, and emergency vehicle access.</p>
                                <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> To increase understanding of the potential impact of threats and hazards on the school buildings and grounds; the risks and vulnerabilities of the school buildings and grounds; and which facilities are physically accessible to students, staff, parents, volunteer workers, and emergency response personnel with disabilities (and thus are in compliance with the law).</p>

                                <p><strong>Description:</strong> In schools with positive climates, students are more likely to feel connected to adults and their peers. This fosters a nurturing environment where students are more likely to succeed, feel safe, and report threats. A school culture and climate assessment evaluates student and staff connectedness to the school as well as problem behaviors. For example, this assessment may reveal a high number of bullying incidents, indicating a need to implement an anti-bullying program. If a student survey is used to assess culture and climate, student privacy must be protected. A range of school personnel can assist in the assessment of culture and school climate, including school counselors and mental health staff.</p>
                                <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> To gain knowledge of students’ and staff members’ perceptions of their safety and of problem behaviors that need to be addressed to improve school climate.</p>

                                <p><strong>Description:</strong> A school threat assessment analyzes communication and behaviors to determine whether or not a student, staff member, or other person may pose a threat. These assessments must be based on fact; must comply with applicable privacy, civil rights, and other applicable laws; and are often conducted by multidisciplinary threat assessment teams. While a planning team may include the creation of a threat assessment team in its plan, the assessment team is a separate entity from the planning team and meets on its own regular schedule.</p>
                                <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> To identify students, staff, or other persons who may pose a threat--before the threat develops into an incident--and to refer those individuals for services, if appropriate.</p>

A capacity assessment examines the capabilities of students and staff as well as the services and material resources of community partners. This assessment is used to identify people in the building with applicable skills (e.g., first aid certification, search and rescue training, counseling and mental health expertise, ability to assist individuals with disabilities and others with access and functional needs). Equipment and supplies should also be inventoried. The inventory should include an evaluation of equipment and supplies uniquely for individuals with disabilities, such as evacuation chairs, the availability of sign language interpreters and technology used for effective communication, accessible transportation, and consumable medical supplies and durable medical equipment that may be necessary during a shelter-in-place or evacuation.</p>
                                <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> To have an increased understanding of the resources available. Information about staff capabilities will help planners assign roles and responsibilities in the plan. </p>
