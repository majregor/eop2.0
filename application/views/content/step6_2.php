    <p>The  first step in implementing the school EOP is to train everyone involved in the  plan on his or her roles and responsibilities before, during, and after an  emergency. Your planning team should consider conducting the following  activities when training stakeholders on the plan.</p>
    <p><strong>Hold a meeting</strong>. At  least once a year, hold a meeting to educate all parties on the plan. </p>
    <p><strong>Visit evacuation sites</strong>.  Show involved parties not only where evacuation sites are located, but also  where specific areas&mdash;such as reunification areas, media areas, and triage areas&mdash;will  be located.</p>
    <p><strong>Give involved parties appropriate and  relevant literature on the plan, policies, and procedures</strong>. It  may also be helpful to provide all parties with <a href="#" class="bt" title="Your school planning team should consider preparing translated versions of these reference guides to support individuals with limited English proficiency.">quick reference guides on key courses of action.</a></p>
    <p><strong>Post key information throughout the  buildings</strong>. It is important that students and staff members are  familiar with and have easy access to information such as evacuation routes and  shelter-in-place procedures and locations. Communicate key information to individuals  with disabilities and other access and functional needs by distributing the  materials in an accessible format.</p>
    <p><strong>Familiarize students and staff with  community partners</strong>. Bring community partners (e.g., law  enforcement officers, fire officials, and EMS personnel) to the school to talk  about the plan in order to help students and staff members feel more  comfortable working with these partners.</p>
    <p><strong>Train staff members on the skills  necessary to fulfill their roles</strong>. Staff members will be  assigned specific roles in the plan and in support of ICS that require special  skills and training, such as first aid, threat assessment, and provision of  personal assistance services for individuals with disabilities and other access  and functional needs. Substitute teachers must also be trained on their roles  in the plan.</p>
