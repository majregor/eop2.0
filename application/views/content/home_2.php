        <p>As lessons learned from experience indicate that operational planning is best performed by a team, Federal guidance recommends that schools assemble collaborative planning teams to work through the process of developing school EOPs. To encourage collaboration among team members, EOP ASSIST has been designed to allow multiple members from a team to use the tool. Suggestions for how teams might use the tool are outlined below. </p>
        <p><strong>Suggestions for using EOP ASSIST as a team</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
            <ul>
                <ul>
                    <li>Assemble a preliminary planning team.</li>
                    <li>Review EOP ASSIST as a team to understand the nature of this tool.</li>
                    <li>Decide how your team will use EOP ASSIST. Because EOP ASSIST allows multiple users to input plan information for each school site, your team will need to decide how to record your plan information into the tool. Will your team select one person to record plan information, or will multiple people record plan information?</li>
                    <li>Coordinate your team&rsquo;s efforts in using EOP ASSIST. If your team decides that multiple people will input information into EOP ASSIST, then your team should identify roles and responsibilities for each person on the team who is using the tool. Additionally, multiple users should coordinate their efforts so that one user does not accidentally change another user&rsquo;s work.</li>
