    <p>Congratulations!  Your planning team has just finished the first draft of your school EOP. The  content of your plan is now viewable using the <a href="report_static.php" target="_blank">My EOP</a> export feature and is  ready for your planning team&rsquo;s review. </p>
    <p>To  review your draft plan, please take the following steps:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>1.Visit <a href="report_static.php" target="_blank">My EOP</a> and then export your plan to Microsoft Word.</p>
        <p>2. Invite  the rest of the planning team and other stakeholders to conduct a review of the  EOP for plan content and writing conventions. This <a href="<?php echo base_url(); ?>assets/resources/EOP_Review_Checklist.pdf" target="_blank" >checklist</a> may  prove useful for this review.</p>
        <p>3. Revise  the plan accordingly. Substantive revisions should be made into the Step 5  fields in the Planning Process, rather than directly in the Word document. Only  small formatting adjustments should be made directly into the Word document.</p>
        <p>4. Save  an electronic copy of the revised plan in a secure location. </p>
    </blockquote>

    <ol>
    </ol>
    <p>After  your planning team has reviewed and finalized the plan, the team should present  it to the appropriate leadership to obtain official approval. The planning team  should then share the plan with <a href="#" class="bt" title="Such as first responders or local emergency management staff.">community partners</a> and <a href="#" class="bt" title="Including relevant district, local, regional, and/or state agencies with which the plan will be coordinated.">other stakeholders</a> with a role in the plan, including other organizations that may use the school  building(s). Planning teams may want to share only certain parts of the plans,  or modified plans, with some stakeholders.<br />
        <br />
        Schools  should be careful to protect the plan from those who are not authorized to have  it, and should consider how they will secure documents shared electronically. Law enforcement agencies and first responders have a secured, Web-accessible  site available to house copies of plans, building schematics, phone contact  sheets, and other important details that round out planning. Schools must  comply with state and local open records laws in storing and protecting the  plan.</p>
