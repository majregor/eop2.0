    <p>After  developing a comprehensive list of threats and hazards, and collecting  information about those threats
        and hazards, the planning team should  consolidate all of the information it has obtained into a format that is
        usable  for evaluating and comparing the risks posed by the identified threats and  hazards. This will allow the
        team to prioritize which threats or hazards it  will directly address in the plan. </p>
    <p>In order to evaluate the risk and  vulnerability of a particular threat or hazard, your team should depict
        scenarios  of each threat and hazard unfolding at your school, and then consider the risk  criteria of
        magnitude, duration, probability, and warning time associated with  the threat or hazard, as well as how
        different variables could affect the different  risk criteria. For example, consider how the warning time
        for a school fire might  differ if the cause of the fire is a wildfire spreading across a nearby forest versus
        an accidental explosion in a science lab? At this stage in the planning  process, it is suggested that your
        planning team err on the side of caution in  determining risk and identifying vulnerabilities. </p>
    <p>One way to evaluate risk is to use a mathematical approach that assigns index numbers (e.g., a 1-to-4 scale) for
        different categories of information used in the ranking scheme. Using this approach, the planning team may
        categorize threats and hazards as posing a relatively high, medium, or low risk. Click
