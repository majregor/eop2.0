    <p>Now  that your planning team has a comprehensive, yet prioritized list of threats  or hazards, Step 3 will prompt your team to select which threats or hazards  will be included in the EOP, and then to develop <a href="#" class="bt" title="Goals are broad, general statements that indicate the desired outcome in response to a threat or hazard.">goals</a> and <a href="#" class="bt" title="Objectives are specific, measurable actions that are necessary to achieve the goals.">objectives</a>  for  addressing those selected threats or hazards. </p>
    <p><strong>Select Threats and Hazards to Address in  the School EOP </strong></p>
    <p>Your  team&rsquo;s first task is to review the prioritized list of threats or hazards from  Step 2 and to select which of those threats or hazards will be addressed in  the school EOP. </p>
    <p><strong>Develop Goals and Objectives for Threats  or Hazards </strong></p>
    <p>Next,  your planning team will develop three goals (before, during, and after) to  address each selected threat or hazard, and then develop corresponding  objectives for each goal.&nbsp;Some goals and objectives apply to multiple  threats or hazards and are therefore considered cross-cutting functions. During  the process of developing goals and objectives for threats or hazards, your  team will also need to identify which goals and objectives are functions and  which are not. </p>
    <p><strong>Develop Goals and Objectives for  Functions</strong></p>
    <p>After  identifying cross-cutting functions, your team will develop goals and objectives  for each function. </p>
    <p><strong>Outcome of Step 3</strong></p>
    <p>At the conclusion of Step 3, your planning team will have developed goals and objectives for each threat, hazard, and function. These goals and objectives will be carried forward to Step 4 and will be used as the basis for courses of action. Goals, objectives, and courses of action will ultimately form the Functional Annexes and Threat- and Hazard-Specific Annexes of the school EOP.</p>
