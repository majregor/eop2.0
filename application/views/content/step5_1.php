    <p>Now that your planning team has completed all of the preparatory work for the school EOP, Step 5 will prompt your team to format this material into a plan. Although there are many ways to format an EOP, EOP ASSIST will guide your team to create a plan with the following sections: (1) <a href="#" class="bt" title="The Basic Plan section of the school EOP provides an overview of the school’s approach to emergency operations. Although the Basic Plan section guides the development of the more operationally oriented annexes, its primary audiences consist of the school, local emergency officials, and the community (as appropriate)">Basic Plan</a>, (2) <a href="#" class="bt" title="The Functional Annexes section details the goals, objectives, and courses of action of functions (e.g., evacuation, lockdown, recovery) that apply across multiple threats or hazards. Functional annexes set forth how the school manages a function before, during, and after an emergency.">Functional Annexes,</a> and (3) <a href="#" class="bt" title="The Threat- and Hazard-Specific Annexes section specifies the goals, objectives, and courses of action that a school will follow to address a particular type of threat or hazard (e.g., hurricane, active shooter). Threat- and hazard-specific annexes, like functional annexes, set forth how the school manages a function before, during, and after an emergency.">Threat- and Hazard-Specific Annexes.</a> </p>
    <p><strong>Prepare the Draft EOP </strong></p>
    <p>First, your planning team will need to create a draft of the school EOP, beginning with the Threat- and Hazard-Specific and Functional Annexes. At this stage, your team has already developed the content for these annexes—which includes the <a href="#" class="bt" title="Goals are broad, general statements that indicate the desired outcome in response to a threat or hazard.">goals</a>, <a href="#" class="bt" title="Objectives are specific, measurable actions that are necessary to achieve the goals.">objectives</a>, and <a href="#" class="bt" title="Courses of action are the specific procedures used to accomplish goals and objectives. They address the what, who, when, where, why, and how for each threat, hazard, and function.">courses of action</a> developed in Step 3 and Step 4. As such, your team will just need to format this content into the EOP annexes. In addition to the Threat- and Hazard-Specific and Functional Annexes, your team will also draft the Basic Plan section. <br />
    </p>
    <p><strong>Review, Approve, and Share the Plan</strong></p>
    <p>After  your planning team has finished preparing the draft EOP, your team will <a href="#" class="bt" title="Note: Your planning team will have to review the school EOP two different times in the six step planning process, in Step 5 and Step 6. Here, in Step 5, your team is charged with reviewing a draft of the plan. In Step 6, your team will need to regularly review the published plan as part of regular plan updating and maintenance. These two types of reviews should not be confused with one another.">review</a>  an  exported version of the plan using the <a href="report_static.php" target="_blank">My EOP</a> feature of EOP ASSIST. Your team  must review this draft for both plan content and writing conventions, and  revise the plan accordingly. After reviewing the draft and revising the plan,  your planning team must obtain official approval of the plan and then share the  plan with community partners and additional stakeholders who may have a role in  the plan. </p>
    <p><strong>Outcome of Step 5</strong></p>
    <p>At  the conclusion of Step 5, your planning team will have an approved EOP that is  ready to be implemented by your school. </p>
